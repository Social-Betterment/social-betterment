You are to code a Chrome Extension using best practices.

- The Chrome Extension will intercept the submit button for any text field on the page.
- Detect and intercept any new text fields and submit buttons that appear on the page.
- On hover over the submit button display an injected html dialog asking if the user really wants to submit it.
- The dialog will al display the results of Perspective APIs analysis of the text in the text field.
- It will display the user's text colour coded to highlight the problematic text spans.
